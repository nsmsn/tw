<h1>About the Band</h1>

<p>The core of the Tumbleweeds is the trio: consisting of <strong>Joe Carter</strong>, <strong>Jordan Ripley</strong> and <strong>Byron Ripley</strong>.</p>

<h2>Joe Carter</h2>

<img class="profile-img" src="assets/img/joe-bio.jpg" alt="Joe Carter"/>
<p>A native of the Texas hill country, Joe Carter now calls the Southwest home, but the music of the Texas dance halls and Honky Tonks has stayed with him. While in his late 50's he started playing music professionally after him and Byron Ripley put together a duo called the Tumbleweeds.

They have worked together off and on for the last 12 years. Now the Tumbleweeds are a 4 or 5 piece band.

He says he's finally doing what he's really wanted to all his life.</p>

<p>When the setting is right, the Tumbleweeds perform as the trio, but when a dance band is needed, bass, drums and steel guitar are added.</p>

<p>This includes our family of amazingly talented musicians, that you can read more about below.</p>
